00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:00.450
Firecom.

2
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:00.689
Hi Firecom,

3
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.789
Battalion 20 here.

4
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.250
Hi.

5
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.949
I'm seeing that train derailment.

6
00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:05.355
Yes.

7
00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:05.658
In Dupont,

8
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.010
is that pretty significant?

9
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.120
Yes, super,

10
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.200
super significant.

11
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.999
They've got at least 12 bodies on
the

12
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.340
tracks and several vehicles under
the train.

13
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.579
Do you need,

14
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.998
do you need resources from West
Pierce?

15
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.800
Um,

16
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.350
Battalion 20 wants to know if they
need resources

17
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.220
from West Pierce.

18
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.780
OK hold on just a second.

19
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.196
Hey there, it's Lisa.

20
00:00:27.453 --> 00:00:27.709
Hi Lisa.

21
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.970
Who's this?

22
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.310
Who's in command down there?

23
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.120
That's what we're trying to figure out.
