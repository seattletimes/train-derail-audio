00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.930
Fire and medical aid, what's the
address of your emergency?

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.290
This is South Sound with a transfer.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.049
She's in the area of the train

4
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.250
derailment.

5
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.130
Her vehicle is on I-5,

6
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.280
airbags deployed.

7
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.050
She was hit by a mudslide.

8
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.299
OK, so ma'am,

9
00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:15.529
where are you north

10
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.859
or south of Mount Road?

11
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:17.530
Do you know?

12
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.690
I'm

13
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.769
the only car, besides the semi that

14
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.969
made it through the train
derailment.

15
00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:25.130
I was right at the front when it
came.

16
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.659
OK. So we've got multiple

17
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.954
units being dispatched in Joint

18
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.230
Base Lewis-McChord.

19
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.310
I need to know,

20
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.440
were you traveling north

21
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.120
or southbound on I-5?

22
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.709
I was traveling south,

23
00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:38.659
and you can't get to me coming

24
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.560
south because it's completely
blocked.

25
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.269
OK. So did you pass

26
00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:43.380
Mounts Road then?

27
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.960
Are you south of Mounts Road

28
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.980
closer to the bridge?

29
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.730
I don't know, I'm right,

30
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.720
I'm right south of the train,

31
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.509
I can see it. I'm

32
00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:51.697
like 10 car lengths away from it.

33
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.599
OK, and so,

34
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.129
all right. And the train,

35
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.700
did it fall down on to I-5?

36
00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.430
I can't,

37
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.379
I can't tell, looks like it.

38
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.289
I just saw a huge, I thought it was
a mudslide,

39
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.610
a huge cloud of mud

40
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.289
and dirt came and hit my car

41
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.670
and spun me me around.

42
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.499
OK. So you can't see the train from

43
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.520
where you're at.

44
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.030
OK. And it's blocking...

45
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.250
Because it's dark.

46
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.869
Is it blocking the south?

47
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.770
Yes there's no cars coming through.

48
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.900
Is it blocking the southbound lanes?

49
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.259
There's no cars coming through

50
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.060
it's completely blocked.
