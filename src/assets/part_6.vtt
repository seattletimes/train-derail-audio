Fort Lewis dispatch,

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.430
do you have an emergency?

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.480
Hi this is Firecom.

4
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.369
I just need to find out what
resources

5
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.034
you've got and what do you need from
us?

6
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.569
We've got -- just send

7
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.379
everything. We've got a passenger
train,

8
00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:13.180
there could be...

9
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.320
Yep.

10
00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:14.758
over a hundred hurt

11
00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:14.908
and injured.

12
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:14.981
OK.

13
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.940
Send everything you've got.

14
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.490
OK.

15
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.269
We've got every Fort Lewis resource
en route.

16
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.020
Thank you.
